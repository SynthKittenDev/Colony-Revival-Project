Developer Notes and Commentary on all changes are available at the very bottom of the changelog.

**Last Updated: September 17th, 2025.**

# GAMEPLAY CHANGES
- Multiplayer functionality has been restored completely! Fully working as intended along with a completely custom server.

- Rework of the Colony Ranking System, implementing 35 new ranks and icons, new XP distribution, removed consecutive win bonus and more!
- A large set of AI Improvements for every AI commander.
- 2 new AI commanders, Cpt. Bjorn and Cpt. Haley which play Special Operations and Dual respectably.
- Camera movement overall speed has been greatly increased, allowing you to move around the map quicker.
- Six new gamemodes (3-Square, 8-Square Joker, Vast, Insurgency and Classic) have been added into multiplayer.
- Added the ability to see how many units you currently have selected when selecting a group of units.
- Added new 'Random' option to MP, giving you a random government each time.
- Added a new Options menu to adjust scaling settings, volume of music & sound effects
- Fixed 'right side advantage' where units had their target point (the spot where you shoot) not 
set correctly and ending up further away than the left side, creating a slight disadvantage to left side players.
- Added the new "Multipurpose Structure" building. This structure combines two functionalities: the Precinct, a prison housing ground units, and the Aerodrome, which accommodates various air units. It can stand on its own or compliment both Post or Forge.
- Customize your player colors! In online and quick play, you can now choose the color for yourself and other players! This affects unit colors, base colors and more.
- Quick Play customization! Customize who you play against, their colors or if you just want to watch four AIs go at it!
- Introduced new hotkeys:
  - Press Tab with a selected unit to toggle between different unit types you control on the field.
  - Press V with a selected unit to limit selection to that specific unit type until V is pressed again. This feature helps with precise unit selection and micro-management, especially when units are stacked in front or behind others.
  - Scrolling with your scroll wheel over a unit you own will select all of your units; an alternative to double clicking.
  - Press 'F' or 'G' to instantly go to the very left or the very right sides of the map.

# Developer Notes:

**Multiplayer Functionality** - I've been a fan of colony for a very long time. I was incredibly saddened when the servers first went down, and not being able to play made me really sad. I first joined the Official Colony Community Discord to see if anyone else had been able to get it working again... and to my surprise, no one did! So.. I decided as of March 18th, 2018 to get the multiplayer working again!

**Improved Camera & New Hotkeys** - I've always enjoyed the hotkeys added in during the reign of Krin, but after his leave, I did feel more hotkeys could be used to help with traversal of the map during a match. So by adding the new hotkeys and improving the camera control and speed, I feel that playing is now a lot more fun and fluid than it used to be.

**New Gamemodes** - Per community request, I introduced three new gamemodes to ignite new life in the multiplayer. With these changes, it has opened up possibilities that could only ever be dreamed of and simply weren't possible before.

**Bugfixing** - **SO** many bugs were littered around that were definitely impacting the playing experience of every player. Whether it was double spending by accident, going into negative resources, swapping to a new building or unit with hotkeys and losing your resources or being 'nulled' which basically ruined a match.. it was all so frustrating! I'm so happy I was able to fix every major issue that was plaguing the game and impacting the experience of new or returning players.

**'Angel' Unit** - The new Angel unit was implemented to expand options for aiding air units. I thought it would be neat to introduce a new air option that could in some way aid other air units, and therefore, the "Angel" was made!

**'Mod Groditz' Unit** - The new Groditz unit was implemented to provide a sensible cousin to the 'Mod. Phantom' that can be constructed from the Armory. I felt the Groditz needed some love, and this felt like it fit right in as if it truly belonged!
- - -
**'Far Sniper' Overhaul** - I always had a love for the far sniper, but it felt like it didn't really have a grand purpose. It had uses due to its long range, but most strategies I saw seemed superior to the far sniper. So I imagined a powerful, elite sniper that used a futuristic powerful anti-materiel rifle made to disrupt and eliminate enemy vehicles. I noticed that in a lot of end-games, we would get to a sort of stalemate where both sides had Sphinxs soaking up missiles, with the army behind it along with a large group of medics.<br/><br/>Outside of pure brute force by a larger army or missile spam, I thought there had to be a unit for the job but was weak to mostly everything else... and ta-da! The new and improved Far Sniper is born, built to destroy and break through even the toughest defenses of the late game. I understand if the unit may feel a bit weak at first due to its incredibly long reload time, however, I promise that it has turned the tides of battle before!
- - -
**Various Unit Buffs** - The Groditz, Pride and Gladiator all received numerous buffs to aid in their effectiveness in the current meta. Per community suggestions, we as the community came together to make these changes. The groditz felt as if it was decent, but needed a little more support, receiving a health buff to allow it to fight longer. The Pride felt a bit underwhelming in comparison to the Spec Ops Team, so it received a 1dmg increase per shot to assist it in remaining a strong and suitable option early to mid game.<br/><br/>Lastly, I spent a lot of time learning about the Gladiator unit and what it can do. And I decided although decent, the fact it took 15 seconds to construct felt too long. It has been reduced enough to where it is more viable for all players, not just players playing the fascist government!
- - -
**Anything else** - It's been an incredible 5 years of the server being up and numerous years of updates to this classic and beloved Flash game. And although the ride has sometimes been a bit bumpy (my fault), I'm so thankful for you all believing in me and the project. Although I don't plan to introduce any new large updates to the game, I feel where we are now is where we always wanted the game to be. I'll make sure the game will always remain running, so if one day you feel like playing... it's here for you. :)
